Bitcore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript Bitcoin library.

## Principles

Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient bitcoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement bitcoin apps and services.

## Get Started

```
npm install bitcore-lib-anon
```

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [bitcore documentation](http://bitcore.io/guide/). There's also a [bitcore API reference](http://bitcore.io/api/) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each bitcore utility.

## Security

We're using Bitcore in production, as are [many others](http://bitcore.io#projects), but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a bitcore-lib-anon full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `bitcore-lib-anon.js` and `bitcore-lib-anon.min.js`.


## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anonymousbitcoin/bitcore-lib-anon
cd bitcore-lib-anon
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`
or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.
